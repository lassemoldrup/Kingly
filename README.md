# Kingly

Kingly is a UCI compliant chess engine written in Rust.
You can play against it on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/KinglyBot), where it is currently 2000-2100 rated.

## How to use

Install Rust through [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and run with cargo:

```
cargo run --release
```

Note: For now, the version of rust required is not stabilised, so it might be necessary to switch to the beta branch with

```
rustup toolchain install beta
```

For a graphical experience, add Kingly to your favorite UCI compliant GUI, e.g. [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de).
